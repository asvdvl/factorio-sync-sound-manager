[mod-setting-description]
fssm-use_simple_sound_system=don't create ghost entities for sync playing sound
fssm-debug=enable event and activity logging
fssm-sync-machine-state-with-emitter=if enabled, the mod will poll all machines once a second about their status (running/stopped) and, depending on the option, turn on/off the emitter. if you find that this slows down your game then turn off this setting, the mod does nothing else except check and control
fssm-limit-of-checks=defines how many entities will be checked per tick
fssm-limit-of-actions=defines how many entities will be created/destroyed per tick
fssm-enable-runtime-protect=If you have problems with the mod (crashes), you can try this setting. i personally do not recommend using it, but from my experience as a player know that it is better to have it.
