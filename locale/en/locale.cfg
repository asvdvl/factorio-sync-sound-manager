rwse-working_proto_prefix=this is needed more for debugging purposes, but maybe you want to see how this mod works for other entities
rwse-working_proto_prefix_custom=custom string for `work object`, select <custom> in the line above, the format is the same as in the field above, the full name of the prototype without numbers at the end, for example `-1`, names without such numbers will also not work
